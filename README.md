# Attention based Steering Angle Prediction

This project investigate various sizes of compact ResNet and InceptionNet models to compare their performance. The derived models can achieve state-of-the-art results in terms of steering angle MSE. In addition, we also explore the attention mechanism and investigate its influence on autonomous steering angle prediction.
